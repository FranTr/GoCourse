# GoCourse
This repo contains the materials of my course about Go for GDG Marbella

### How to use
The repo is organized with four branches:

| Session |    Branch   |                          Comment                         |
|---------|:-----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------:|
|   1st   | concurrence |             Basics and concurrent programming            |
|   2nd   |     http    |     HTTP: Client, Server, TLS. Testing HTTP Services     |
|   3rd   |   services  |                                                          |
|   4th   |   proyect   | The final proyect where you can try the concepts learned |

### What do you need
1. go: [download and install](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. make
3. docker and docker-compose: this will be required for the last two sessions

### Caveats
This is a fast-forward course, so it's a good idea to previously know something about the language syntax and basic features. The best place to start in my opinion is [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
